Centos 8 Installation Guide
Pre-requisites:
- Centos 8 machine with local IP address
- Access to Internet (for updates and installations)
- External ability to redirect traffic to Centos 8 machine
- GIT files are installed to Home directory

Steps for Install and Run:
1. Install 'Development Tools' using sudo yum install 'Development Tools'
2. Install Responder using sudo python -m pip install responder
3. Optional: Install Flask using sudo python -m pip install Flask
4. Install from GIT using git clone https://github.com/tedder/petnet-api-hacking.git
5. Run mkcert.py using python ~/petnet-api-hacking/mkcert.py
6. Set up Firewall to allow access from PetNet (for development purposes I turned off firewall to confirm nothing was blocking traffic)
7. Comment out lines 224, 229, and 231 (this will alow the app to always run using the certs on port 443)
8. Adjust address on line 228 to match IP address of Centos 8 device
9. Run responderapp.py using sudo python ~/petnet-api-hacking/responderapp.py
